## Course Description

This repository is the semester-long project for CMOR 438 (Rice University Summer 2025). All code for various assignments will be placed in this repository.

## Repository Topics

Most data used in the algorithms come from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository or from Scikit-Learn's library. Links to each data set are provided in the READMEs of the algorithms. The topics learned in this class are the following:

* Supervised Learning
  * The Perceptron
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Neural Networks
  * K Nearest Neighbors
  * Decision Trees / Regression Trees
  * Random Forests
  * Other Ensemble Methods, such as Boosting

* Unsupervised Learning
  * K-Means Clustering
  * DBSCAN
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * Image Compression with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Professor Randy Davila for his help throughout the project and for providing examples of the code in action using various datasets. Some of my code is based on the format of these examples.
