## Repository Topics

Most data used in the algorithms come from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository or from Scikit-Learn's library. Links to each data set are provided in the READMEs of the algorithms. The topics learned in this class are the following:

* Supervised Learning
  * The Perceptron
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Neural Networks
  * K Nearest Neighbors
  * Decision Trees / Regression Trees
  * Random Forests
  * Other Ensemble Methods, such as Boosting

* Unsupervised Learning
  * K-Means Clustering
  * DBSCAN
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * Image Compression with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
