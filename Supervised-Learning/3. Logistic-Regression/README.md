# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression uses a logistic function to model binary variables to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a certain category like "yes" and "no". This produces an S-shaped sigmoidal curve that maps any real number to a number between 0 and 1. The output is a probability score which is the probability of the input being the "positive" output. A threshold, normally 0.5, is used to classify as either "positive" or "negative" output.

## Linear vs Logistic Regression
Both are supervised learning models. However many differences are present including:
* Linear regression values are predicted by an integer while logistic is by 0 or 1
* Only logistic regression has a threshold value
* Linear regression is a linear line while logistic is an S-shaped curve
* Linear regression is used to estimate dependent variables if there is a change in the independent variables. Logistic regression is used for predicting the probability of something happening.
