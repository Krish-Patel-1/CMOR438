# Neural Networks

**Neural Networks** are a core component of modern artificial intelligence and are inspired by the structure and functioning of the **human brain**. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that work together to process input data and make decisions or predictions. Just like how the brain learns through experience, neural networks learn by analyzing large volumes of data, adjusting internal parameters to improve their performance over time...just like doing more practice problems in my LinAlg class helps me make fewer mistakes :D

## Structure of a Neural Network

A basic neural network is composed of the following parts:

### 1. **Input Layer**
- Receives the initial data or features.
- Each node in the input layer represents one feature or attribute of the data.

### 2. **Hidden Layers**
- Consist of one or more layers of nodes between the input and output.
- Each node is connected to nodes in the previous and next layers.
- Perform nonlinear transformations and extract patterns from the input.

### 3. **Output Layer**
- Produces the final prediction or classification result.
- The number of output nodes corresponds to the number of prediction classes or regression targets.

## How Neural Networks Work

Each **connection** between nodes has an associated **weight** that signifies the strength of influence between the nodes. Each node also has a **bias** and a **threshold**.

- A node calculates the **weighted sum** of its inputs.
- If the result exceeds the threshold, the node is **activated** and sends its output to the next layer.

This process continues from the input layer, through hidden layers, and finally to the output layer.

## Training Neural Networks

Neural networks are trained using **labeled data** and an optimization algorithm.

- **Forward Pass**: Input data is passed through the network to generate a prediction.
- **Loss Calculation**: The difference between the predicted and actual outputs is measured using a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification).
- **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**: The error is propagated backward through the network, and weights are updated to reduce the error.

This process is repeated over many **epochs**, gradually improving the model's accuracy.

## Real-World Examples

- **Google Search**: Uses deep learning models to interpret queries and rank relevant results.
- **Voice Assistants**: Neural networks power speech recognition and natural language understanding.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Neural networks process sensor data to recognize objects, signs, and make driving decisions.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix and YouTube use them to suggest personalized content.
