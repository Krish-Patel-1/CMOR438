# Neural Networks
A neural network, as the name suggests, makes decision like the human brain. A neural network has layers of nodes which are like neurons in the brain. Each node is connect to each other and has a weight and threshold. If a node's output is above the threshold value, it is activated and its data is sent to the next layer of nodes.

They are reliant on trainig data which over time increases its accuracy similar to doing practice problems in my LinAlg classes helps me make fewer mistakes :D

If enough training is done and the accuracy is very high, they are capable of classifying and clustering data quickly. Google search is a good example of a neural networks. Over time, the network can recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform complex tasks.
