# K Nearest Neighbors
K nearest neighbors (KNN) assumes that similar data are all close to each other. Essentially, there is some relationship between each datapoint, so predictions are made using known datapoints. 

The "K" represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider and is an important parameter for this algorithm. Assuming K = 5 for example, KNN will use the 5 closest data points (neighbors) to a new data point to make a prediction about that data point.
