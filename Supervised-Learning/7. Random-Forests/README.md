# Random Forests

**Random Forest** is an advanced and powerful ensemble learning method that builds upon the foundation of **decision trees**. Unlike a single decision tree, which can be prone to overfitting and variance, a random forest **combines the outputs of multiple decision trees** to make more accurate and stable predictions. This ensemble approach increases overall performance, reduces overfitting, and works well for both **classification** and **regression** problems.

## How Random Forest Works

The random forest algorithm operates by building multiple decision trees during training time and aggregating their outputs to produce a final prediction. The steps are:

1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: The algorithm generates multiple datasets by randomly sampling (with replacement) from the original training data. This process is called bootstrapping.
2. **Decision Tree Training**: Each sample is used to train a separate decision tree. These trees are grown using random subsets of features (feature bagging) rather than all features, which ensures diversity among the trees.
3. **Prediction Aggregation**:
   - For **classification**, each tree casts a "vote" for the class label, and the final prediction is determined by **majority vote**.
   - For **regression**, the predictions from all trees are **averaged** to get the final output.--

## Pros of Random Forest

- **High Accuracy**: Tends to outperform individual models.
- **Versatile**: Can handle both classification and regression tasks.
- **Robust to Outliers and Missing Values**.
- **Performs Implicit Feature Selection**: Less important features get lower impact across many trees.

## Cons of Random Forest

- **Computationally Intensive**: Training and predicting can be slower than single models, especially with large numbers of trees.
- **Less Interpretable**: Although more accurate, the model is harder to interpret than a single decision tree.
- **Large Model Size**: May require more memory and storage due to multiple trees.
