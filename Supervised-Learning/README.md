# Supervised Learning
According to IBM, supervised learning is a machine learning technique that uses human-labeled input and output datasets to train artificial intelligence models. As input data is fed into the machine learning algorithm, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately. Labeled training data explicitly teaches the model to identify the relationships between features and data labels. 

This allows the model to predict correct outputs based on new, unlabeled real-world input data.

The following topics are covered in supervised learning:
* The Perceptron
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Networks
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees / Regression Trees
* Random Forests
* Other Ensemble Methods, such as Boosting
