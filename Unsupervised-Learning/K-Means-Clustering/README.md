# K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is one of the most popular clustering methods used in machine learning where the algorithm groups unlabeled data points into groups or clusters.

K-Means clustering stipulates that a data point can exist in just one cluster. It is an iterative, centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into similar groups based on the distance between their centroids. The centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.

The algorithm identifies a "k" number of centroids and then allocated every data point to the nearest cluster while keeping the centroids as small as possible.
