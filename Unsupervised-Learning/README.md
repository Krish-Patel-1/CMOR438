# Unsupervised Learning
According to IBM, unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled fata sets.

No human help such as pre-assigned labels or scores are provided so the algorithm must figure out for itself patterns and groupings in the data.

The following topics are covered in unsupervised learning:
* K-Means Clustering
* DBSCAN
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Image Compression with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
