# Unsupervised Learning

**Unsupervised learning** is a branch of machine learning where algorithms are used to analyze and interpret **unlabeled datasets**. Unlike supervised learning, there are **no predefined labels, categories, or outputs** provided to the model. Instead, the algorithm must independently **discover patterns, structures, or relationships** within the data.

According to IBM, unsupervised learning utilizes machine learning techniques to **analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets** without the need for human intervention. This makes it particularly useful in situations where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

## Key Characteristics

- **No Labeled Output**: The algorithm learns by exploring the structure of the input data.
- **Pattern Discovery**: The primary goal is to find **hidden patterns or intrinsic structures** in input data.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Often used for exploring data to understand its distribution, similarities, and differences.

## Applications of Unsupervised Learning

- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detecting unusual patterns in data (e.g., fraud detection).
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products by finding patterns in user behavior.
- **Document Classification**: Grouping articles or emails based on content similarity.

## Advantages

- **No Need for Labeled Data**: Saves time and resources by eliminating the need for manual labeling.
- **Exploratory Power**: Can reveal hidden patterns that are not obvious.
- **Adaptability**: Can be used as a pre-processing step for supervised learning.

## Disadvantages

- **No Objective Performance Metric**: Since there are no labels, itâ€™s hard to measure how well the model is performing.
- **Interpretability**: Results can be harder to interpret and validate.
- **Sensitive to Input Choices**: Algorithm performance often depends on parameters like the number of clusters (in K-Means) or similarity measures.
